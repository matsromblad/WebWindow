# Virtual Glass Window

## Proof of Concept

This repository contains a web-based proof of concept for the Virtual Glass Window project. The POC demonstrates the core concept of a virtual window with parallax effect that responds to head tracking, creating the illusion of depth and looking through a real window into another environment.

### Core Features Demonstrated

- **Parallax Effect**: Multiple depth layers that move at different rates to create a convincing 3D effect
- **Head Tracking**: Uses webcam to track head position and adjust perspective accordingly
- **Mouse Fallback**: Alternative tracking using mouse position when webcam is unavailable
- **Realistic Window Frame**: Visual representation of looking through a window
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Controls for parallax strength and position calibration

### Technology Stack

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the web-based implementation
- Face-API.js for face detection and head tracking
- SVG for scalable vector graphics rendering of the scene
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Host the files on a local web server (required for webcam access)
3. Open the index.html file in a modern browser
4. Click "Start Tracking" to begin
5. Use the slider to adjust parallax strength
6. Click "Calibrate Position" to set your current position as neutral
7. Switch between mouse and head tracking modes as needed

### Browser Requirements

- Modern browser with webcam access capabilities
- HTTPS or localhost environment (for webcam security)
- Chrome/Firefox/Edge recommended

## Vision for UE5 Implementation

The web-based POC serves as a demonstration of the core concept. The full implementation in Unreal Engine 5 will dramatically expand the capabilities and visual quality of the Virtual Glass Window.

### Enhanced Features Planned for UE5 Version

#### Visual Quality
- **Photorealistic Rendering**: Leverage UE5's Nanite and Lumen technologies for stunning visual fidelity
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Real-time global illumination and time-of-day changes
- **Weather Effects**: Rain, snow, fog, and condensation effects on glass
- **Physical Materials**: Realistic glass with proper reflection, refraction, and transparency

#### Environments
- **Multiple Detailed Environments**: Beach, mountain, forest, and city scenes with rich detail
- **Dynamic Elements**: Wildlife, vegetation movement, water simulation
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Clouds, fog, haze with atmospheric perspective
- **Seasonal Variations**: Each environment can be experienced in different seasons

#### Window System
- **Customizable Windows**: Different frame styles (Modern, Rustic, Classic)
- **Interactive Elements**: Open/close windows, adjust blinds, curtains
- **Glass Types**: Clear, frosted, tinted with accurate visual properties
- **Window Interactions**: Tap on glass, draw on condensation

#### Head Tracking
- **Advanced Tracking**: More precise and robust head position tracking
- **Depth Sensing**: Support for depth cameras for improved accuracy
- **Eye Tracking**: Optional support for eye tracking hardware
- **Virtual Camera**: Physical camera model with proper perspective and depth of field

#### Audio
- **Spatial Audio**: 3D positional audio for immersive soundscapes
- **Environment-Specific Sounds**: Unique ambient audio for each environment
- **Weather Sounds**: Rain, wind, thunder as appropriate
- **Interactive Audio**: Response to window interactions

#### Performance
- **Optimized Rendering**: LOD systems for maintaining performance
- **Scalable Quality**: Settings to work on a range of hardware
- **Asset Streaming**: Dynamic loading of environment assets
